# Implifit
A type checker based on system F-omega with pattern unifiction and implicit parameters

### Future Ideas
- allow overloading `*` (collision with kind star)

- custom type formers (very simple ADTs)
- shallow pattern matching on ADTs, possibly "real" matching too

- error reporting
    - from parsing
    - from typechecking

- annotate core types with kinds
- check with bidi to accept more programs
- small & super simple module system and stdlib

- backend
