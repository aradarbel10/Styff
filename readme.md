# Implifit
A type checker based on system F-omega with pattern unifiction and implicit parameters

### Future Ideas
- expose type-level application to user, kinds, type definitions
- operators on built-in types (maybe full user-defined operators??)
- recursive bindings
- custom type formers (very simple ADTs)
- shallow pattern matching on ADTs, possibly "real" matching too
- check with bidi to accept more programs
- small & super simple module system and stdlib
