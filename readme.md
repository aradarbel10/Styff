# Implifit
A type checker based on system F-omega with pattern unifiction and implicit parameters

### Future Ideas
- program structure
- type definitions

- operators on built-in types (maybe full user-defined operators??)
- postulates
- recursive bindings

- custom type formers (very simple ADTs)
- shallow pattern matching on ADTs, possibly "real" matching too

- annotate core types with kinds
- check with bidi to accept more programs
- small & super simple module system and stdlib
